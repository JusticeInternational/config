# Introduction

This is a place holder for now, we're working on setting up some of our initial configurations for how we'll deploy app components.

Here are some of the working parts:

1. [Setup the backend using Human Connections app](https://github.com/JusticeInternational/Human-Connection). We'll use the `master` branch to keep up to date with upstream, and the `stable` branch to deploy from since most of this will be 3rd party. We may use other branches to help with our development process.
2. The Venezuela team has started a [proto-type android app](https://github.com/JusticeInternational/RedSol-android). This will be our focus for end-user interactions.
3. This project, will be used for project management, demos, docs, and automation we use to configure all the things.

Future apps we'll need may include:

- Updates to Human-Connection to help us develop new data-modesl and helper api's to use within mobile apps.
- We'll have an iOS app
