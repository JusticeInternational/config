# Introduction

This is a place holder for now, we're working on setting up some of our initial configurations for how we'll deploy app components.

Here are some of the working parts:

1. [Setup the backend using Human Connections app](docs/setup-backend.md). We'll use the `master` branch to keep up to date with upstream, and the `stable` branch to deploy from since most of this will be 3rd party. We may use other branches to help with our development process.
2. [The Venezuela team](https://github.com/orgs/JusticeInternational/teams/venezueladevteam/members) has started a [proto-type android app](https://github.com/JusticeInternational/RedSol-android). This will be our focus for end-user interactions.
3. This project, will be used for [project management](https://github.com/JusticeInternational/project-config/projects/1), [demos](demos/README.md), [docs](docs/README.md), and [automation we use to configure](config/README.md) all the things.

Future apps we'll need may include:

- Updates to Human-Connection to help us develop new data-modesl and helper api's to use within mobile apps.
- We'll have an iOS app
