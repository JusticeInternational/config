# Development
Here are some of the bootstraping notes for setting up [Human Connections](https://github.com/JusticeInternational/Human-Connection).
Things that help us here:

- A social networking platform that comes with a baked backend-data-model
- A standard API mechanism to query the data-model using GraphQL

## Build
- Clone the Human Connections repo: `git clone https://github.com/JusticeInternational/Human-Connection`

## Testing

## Deployment
