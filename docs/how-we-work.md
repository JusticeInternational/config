# Lets get started

- We're communicating on [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/). The group name is *RedSol Developers Team*. Please open an issue and request to be invited if your working as a developer on the project or want to volunteer.
- We're using this repo as the primary space for capturing work, task and [general project direction](https://github.com/JusticeInternational/project-config/projects/1). We'll ask for help here and try to cordinate efforts with each other.
