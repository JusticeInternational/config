We're looking for volunteers all the time, and this is the right place to get started. We'd like you to open an issue to help you get connected and help us with contributions to the projects. Please start with this check list:

- [ ] Provide an email address where we can contact you so we can send more info.
- [ ] Get WhatsApp installed and setup so we can eventually connect on WhatsApp
- [ ] Learn more by reading [our docs](https://github.com/JusticeInternational/project-config/blob/master/docs/README.md)
